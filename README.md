This project was created out of boredom with ipsum everywhere, and the desire to build something just for fun.

It utilizes a backend to scrape Urban Dictionary to pull popular words and phrases, and responds to requests from its frontend to return totally random paragraphs composed of Urban Dictionary content.

Have fun! Somewhat NSFW, just as a heads up, which should come as a surprise to literally no one.

Stack: Django, DRF, React, Axios

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
